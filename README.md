Local Shelf

  Local Shelf is a community-focused web platform designed to help neighbors and local shops connect. It allows shop owners to upload images of their items so nearby users can browse them online, saving time and avoiding unnecessary trips.

Motivation

  I noticed a common problem in my neighborhood: people would walk to shops just to see if new items were available, only to find nothing new. To solve this, I created a website where neighbors can upload and view items available in nearby shops. This way, everyone can quickly check what’s new without wasting time.
